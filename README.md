# Entropic Perspective in Neuroscience

One of the biggest challenges in understanding neuroscientific studies is their wide scope, which spans very different fields such as biology, mathematics, statistics, information theory, and linear algebra. This integration of multiple disciplines gives rise to the emergence of concepts that may initially appear irrelevant. However, these are in fact essential for building a coherent understanding of brain function.
